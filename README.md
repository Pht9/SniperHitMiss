ðŸŽ¯ Sniper Hit Accuracy Dataset
This dataset is curated for machine learning research on target hit prediction under varied combat and environmental conditions. It simulates real-world sniper scenarios involving dynamic factors such as shooter skill, target distance, wind parameters, and target motion, making it suitable for tactical simulations, defense analytics, and sports shooting research.

ðŸ“š Origin
The dataset is inspired by the methodology discussed in

"Predicting Rifle Shooting Accuracy from Contextual and Sensor Data" â€“
[UCL Research Repository, 2022].

It reflects core variables and experimental design principles aligned with studies from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and UCL academic archives, where similar multi-variable shooter datasets have been proposed for performance modeling and outcome classification.
